# README
The following repository contains the project submission for 4th year module Gesture Based UI. The goal of the project was to develop an application with a Natural User Interface. We could develop the application using a language of our choice. We also had multiple different types of hardware that we could use. 
## Repository Structure
The repository is set up as follows
- The main project code is found within the application folder. This is broken up into the code which runs on the Lego computer brick 
and the code which runs on the PC.
- A pdf document which breaks down the research for the project.
- A video demonstrating the application working.
- A presentation 
- A licence
## Running Application
To run the application the following sets need to be completed
### Required Software
The following software need to be installed to run the application. **Note that 32bit versions of the software are required to work with the Leap Motion Controller**.
